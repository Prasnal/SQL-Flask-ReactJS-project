# SQL-Flask-ReactJS-project

##Description:
This is university project for SQL lab. My task was use to SQL to create application which is using database.


## Usage:
You need Flask framework and some libraries, you can install it using command: <br />
$ pip install -r requirements.txt <br />
You need also the newest version of NodeJS (details about installation available in README.md in folder "react-webpack-starter-kit") <br />
After installation write command in main folder:
<br />
$ python main.py
<br />
in other terminal in folder react-webpack-starter-kit write command: <br />
$ npm start <br />
now application is available at page http://127.0.0.1:8080/
<br />
<br />
It's university program. Because of short deadline I don't have time to do all functions I wanted. 
<br />

## TODO: <br />
* Translate SQL and some functions to English (In university I needed write it at Polish language) <br />
* Fix some bugs (for example tags) <br />
